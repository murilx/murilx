Hi there! My name is Murilo Geraldini and I'm a brazilian computer science student, studying at UNESP. I live in Mogi Mirim, São Paulo
and I have a will to help people with technology and software. 💻

### IDE

![Neovim bagde](https://img.shields.io/badge/NeoVim-%2357A143.svg?&style=for-the-badge&logo=neovim&logoColor=white)

I have been using vim for almost 4 years and feel very comfortable with but decided to give Neovim a try. With these ones I feel my 
workflow flowing as naturally as possible and as efficient as possible and I can't live without anymore. If I need to use other text editor
or IDE I'll probably search for a vim plugin.

I also use Eclispe IDE when I need to develop in java. ☕
