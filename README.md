### IDE

I have been using vim for almost 4 years and feel very comfortable with but decided to give Neovim a try. With these ones I feel my 
workflow flowing as naturally as possible and as efficient as possible and I can't live without anymore. If I need to use other text editor
or IDE I'll probably search for a vim plugin.

I also use Eclispe IDE when I need to develop in java. â˜•
