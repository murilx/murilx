* Python was my first programming language. I have been learning Python since 2017 and I still love how simple and quick is to create
anything with python.

* Shell script came right after Python when I started using Linux as my main OS in 2017. I really like the idea of creating simples scripts to
automate something in my computer and shell is my first bet! 

* I'm studing C since 2019. It's quite recent but I really fell in love with this language. Being a "low level" language really
taught me a lot of incredible and useful things and made me understand a lot more about programming.

* I also have some knowledge with markup languages as markdown and LaTeX, which I use as part of my routine to take notes and to write
my college articles.

### I'm still learning
![C++ badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%2B%2B-00599C?style=for-the-badge&logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white)
![Java badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-ED8B00?style=for-the-badge&logo=java&logoColor=white)

I don't have that much contact with these two. In fact, my first contact was in 2021 when I was learning object-oriented programming
at college. Yet, I really like these two and the object-oriented paradigm in general and want to learn more! I'm sure I can make great
stuff with these since they are very powerful languages and I can't let them outside my knowledge box. 

### IDE
![Vim badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/VIM-%2311AB00.svg?&style=for-the-badge&logo=vim&logoColor=white)
![Neovim badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/NeoVim-%2357A143.svg?&style=for-the-badge&logo=neovim&logoColor=white)

I have been using vim for almost 4 years and feel very comfortable with but decided to give Neovim a try. With these ones I feel my 
workflow flowing as naturally as possible and as efficient as possible and I can't live without anymore. If I need to use other text editor
or IDE I'll probably search for a vim plugin.

I also use Eclispe IDE when I need to develop in java. â˜• 

### About my Linux love
I've been using linux since 2017 as my daily OS. Between the distros I've used I can cite
